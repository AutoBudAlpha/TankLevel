# TankLevel
This microcontroller runs on a ESP32 with a connected HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. This device can be calibrated to measure the liquid level as well as remaining fluid in a reserve. I am testing this device in both my home water cistern as well water reserves for both indoor and outdoor plants.
